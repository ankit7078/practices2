      <h1>Introduction to Operating-System:-</h1>
      <p>
        An operating system acts as an intermediary between the user of a
        computer and computer hardware. The purpose of an operating system is to
        provide an environment in which a user can execute programs in a
        convenient and efficient manner. An operating system is a software that
        manages the computer hardware. The hardware must provide appropriate
        mechanisms to ensure the correct operation of the computer system and to
        prevent user programs from interfering with the proper operation of the
        system.

      <h5>What is Operating-System</h5>
      <p>
        Operating System lies in the category of system software. It basically
        manages all the resources of the computer. An operating system acts as
        an interface between the software and different parts of the computer or
        the computer hardware. The operating system is designed in such a way
        that it can manage the overall resources and operations of the computer.
        Operating System is a fully integrated set of specialized programs that
        handle all the operations of the computer. It controls and monitors the
        execution of all other programs that reside in the computer, which also
        includes application programs and other system software of the computer.
        Examples of Operating Systems are Windows, Linux, Mac OS, etc. An
        Operating System (OS) is a collection of software that manages computer
        hardware resources and provides common services for computer programs.
        The operating system is the most important type of system software in a
        computer system.

      <h3>Types of Operating-System</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Batch Operating System:</li>
        <div class="aman4">
          <p>
            A Batch Operating System is a type of operating system that does not
            interact with the computer directly. There is an operator who takes
            similar jobs having the same requirements and groups them into
            batches.
          </p>
        </div>
        <div class="aman5">
          <h6>Diagram of batch operating-system</h6>
        </div>
        <li>Time-sharing Operating System:</li>
        <p>
          Time-sharing Operating System is a type of operating system that
          allows many users to share computer resources (maximum utilization of
          the resources).
        </p>

        <li>Network Operating System:</li>
        <p>
          These systems run on a server and provide the capability to manage
          data, users, groups, security, applications, and other networking
          functions. These types of operating systems allow shared access to
          files, printers, security, applications, and other networking
          functions over a small private network. One more important aspect of
          Network Operating Systems is that all the users are well aware of the
          underlying configuration, of all other users within the network, their
          individual connections, etc. and thatâ€™s why these computers are
          popularly known as tightly coupled systems.
        </p>
        <li>Real-time Operating System:</li>
        <p>
          These types of OSs serve real-time systems. The time interval required
          to process and respond to inputs is very small. This time interval is
          called response time. Real-time systems are used when there are time
          requirements that are very strict like missile systems, air traffic
          control systems, robots, etc.
        </p>
        <li>Multiprocessing Operating System:</li>
        <p>
          Multi-Processing Operating System is a type of Operating System in
          which more than one CPU is used for the execution of resources. It
          betters the throughput of the System.
